Pavol Dilung's Gentoo Linux Overlay
===================================

This is my personal Gentoo overlay where I maintain packages I create or
modify. If anything is out of date or doesn't build on your system, create
a [new issue](https://github.com/pdilung/gentoo-overlay/issues/new) and attach
a copy of the build log from a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/).


Installation
------------

The easiest way to add this overlay to your Portage tree is through
__layman(8)__.

```
# emerge -av layman
# layman -a pdilung
```
